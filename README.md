# Movie-Launch
Simulating the launch of a new movie company, Microsoft Movies, I analyse current basic box office trends to find insights into potential key factors to take into account for the new business. 3 major takeaways were presented with potential to further explore in this business venture.

# 1. ROI/Profit Curve
Upon examining presentation of all ROIs and Profits plotted against each other and even for the top 100 ROIs and top 100 movie profits plotted against each other a hyperbolic curve trend was discovered which detailed the limit of ROI and profit, where historically, the maximum is. This would help with planning future movies and budgeting for them: understanding where an optimal ROI/profit is and adjusting plans as required. 

# 2. Rating relationship with Profit
Examining ratings against the movie's profit it was determined that there was a slight correlation a movie's rating and its total profit. Joining the ratings table and the profits table on movie ID's and then plotting a trend was observed. Thus a Pearsons Correlation Coefficient test was performed. The Pearsons Correlation Coefficient indicated that there was a weak correlation between Rating and Profit whilst the P-value was 9.0e^-30 indicating a high chance that this was correlation albeit a weak one. The business recommendation stemming from this was to enhance Micorsoft films' potential for creating high rating films by employing personnel who had participated in previously high rated films as well as upon examining techniques from these high rated films. 

# 3. Franchise films garner more profit than non-franchise films
Examined if there was a statistically significant different betweeen the ROIs and the profit of the franchise films versus non-franchise films. Using 4 major franchises - Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and The Avengers: it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the profits of franchise films compared to non-franchise films. Using this information, Micorosft Movies could invest in creating a powerful franchise like those listed, and look to create a loyal fanbase who will keep watching the franchise.
